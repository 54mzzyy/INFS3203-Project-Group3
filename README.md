# **Brief discription about the topic**
Qatar's economic growth strategy aims to diversify its income sources, and tourism is a key part of that plan. The country is actively attracting visitors with a focus on both modern attractions and its cultural heritage.  Their tourism strategy includes making it easier to visit with relaxed visa requirements and a variety of accommodation options.  This focus on tourism is paying off as Qatar was named the Arab Tourism Capital for 2023 and is investing heavily in hotels, museums, and other infrastructure to meet its ambitious goal of attracting 6 million visitors a year by 2030. Investors are encouraged to join this growing market with a streamlined licensing process and other incentives.


# **Project Plan**
**Qatar Tourism Web App - TourQ**



Project Goal: Develop a mobile application that aligns with one of Qatar's NDS goals and addresses a specific societal, economic, or environmental need.

**Timeline:**

- Week 1 (March 19th): Proposal Definition & Planning (Due: March 19th)



- Week 2 (March 26th): Implementation - Part 1 (Due: March 26th)



- Week 3 (April 2nd): Implementation - Part 2 (Due: April 2nd)



- Week 4 (April 9th): CI/CD Pipeline (Due: April 9th)


## Week 1: Proposal Definition & Planning




Team: Up to 4 students

Tasks:

Review Qatar NDS Goals: Familiarize yourselves with the seven strategic goals of the Qatar National Development Strategy (NDS).



Identify a Need: Based on the NDS goals, identify a specific societal, economic, or environmental need in Qatar.



Define App Proposal: Develop a proposal for a simple web app that addresses the identified need.



Explain how the app aligns with the chosen NDS goal(s) and its potential impact.



Project Plan: Create a project plan outlining:


Roles and responsibilities for team members



Development timeline for each phase



App functionalities and requirements



Prototype Development: Design a basic user interface (UI) prototype to visualize the app's concept.



Deliverables:



Team formation confirmation



GitHub repository and project board set up



README file documenting project information and requirements



Basic UI prototype





Presentation for proposal validation



## Week 2: Implementation - Part 1

Focus: Building the foundation

Tasks:

Technology Stack Selection: Choose the programming languages, frameworks, and tools for app development.



Initial Implementation: Begin coding core functionalities based on the project plan and prototype.



Deliverables:
Initial codebase uploaded to the GitHub repository with relevant documentation




## Week 3: Implementation - Part 2

Focus: Completing the app

Tasks:

Feature Implementation: Develop remaining features and functionalities according to the project plan.




Unit Testing: Implement unit tests to ensure code quality and functionality.



Preparation for Integration: Prepare the app for integration and complete system testing.



Deliverables:
Working mobile app with all planned features



Updated codebase and documentation on the repository



Implemented unit test cases




## Week 4: CI/CD Pipeline

Focus: Automation and Reliability

Tasks:

CI Pipeline Setup: Establish a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automate building and testing the app upon code changes.


Documentation & Reporting: Update project documentation and prepare a final report outlining the development process, CI/CD setup, and app functionalities.


Optional: CD Pipeline Setup (Optional): Set up a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline to automate deployment of the app to a cloud platform for real-world testing and feedback (optional due to limited time).



Deliverables:
Fully functional CI pipeline integrated with the project repository



Updated project documentation and a final report



(Optional) Functional CD pipeline set up for automated deployment



Note: This plan prioritizes a functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within the given timeframe. Additional features and functionalities can be considered based on time availability and future development.
